Arrays:
	derived data type -> collection of multiple items of similar data type

int a ={100,200,300,400,500,.........n}

	Syntax : <<datatype>> <<var_name>> [size] = { values};

			     -a[1]=20

Object Orientation:
	1. Object - Real Time entity
\ & Classes - Collection of data members and member functions
	2. Encapsulation
			wrapping up of data and entities together
			steps :
				1. define all members as private.
				2. use getters/setters statement
	3. Polymorphism
		poly -> Many, Morph -> Shapes
		functions:
			building block
			user-defined functions
				<<return_type>> <name_of_the_function>>(argument....list)
				{

				}
		Constructor:
			->similar to functions
			->used for memory allocation
			->Name of class -> name of constructor
			->no return type
			->no explicit calling//automatically called whenever an object is created
		Generally:
			Function Overloading
				1. Function name must be similar
				2. Must be defined in same class
				3. May differ by number or type of arguments
			Constructor Overloading
	4. Inheritance
		->relationship
		->process of creating a new class from existing class
		-> Class A
		   {

   		    }
		-> New Class -> Child Class, Derived Class, Subclass
		-> Existing Class -> Parent Class, Base Class, Super Class
		->Types of Inheritance:
			1. Single Inheritance -> One Base Class -> Only One Derived Class
			2. Multiple Inheritance -> More than Base Class -> Only One Derived Class
				->interfaces
			3. Multilevel Inheritance -> Base Class -> Derived Class -> Dc1 ->Dc2->..............n
			4. Hybrid Inheritance -> Combination of any type of inheritance
			5. Hierarchical Inheritance -> One Base class -> Multiple Derived Class
		->Syntax of Creating Derived Class:
			class <<derived_class_name>> extends <<base_class_name>>
			Sorting
				
			swapping
				a=5
				b=10
				a=10;b=5
		->Interfaces:
			1. similar to classes
			2. method declaration alone is applicable
			3. Interface instantiation is not possible



Inheritance:
		Derived Class object is required.
	5. Abstraction
